    <h3>Paradise Tanager: The Jewel of the Rainforest</h3>
    <div>The Paradise Tanager is a stunning bird with beautiful colours that is a true gem in the avian world. It comes from the rainforests of South America and showcases the beauty of nature. This bird has a one-of-a-kind colour scheme that will leave you mesmerised.

Living high in the treetops, Paradise Tanagers have an important role in their surroundings.They eat fruits and insects, helping control insect populations and scatter seeds throughout the forest. This scattering of seeds is vital for renewing the rainforest, a place that supports a diverse range of plant and animal life. The rainforest is also crucial for the health of our planet.

Its body has a rich turquoise blue covering the head, neck, and back, which gives it a luminous quality. This blue merges smoothly into a deep green that covers the wings and tail, making a beautiful contrast. The most stunning feature is its belly, which has a brilliant fiery red, adding an intense burst of colour that stands out amazingly against the more subtle greens and blues.</div>
